display or flex align the items side by side

linear gradient run from a straight line from one direction to another


radient gradient start from the center and spread

to get rid of dot you use list-style

to give space between menu we use a gap 

to remove underline we use text decoration

vh means view hight

mixin

JS_______________________

js i a scripting language

js is red from top to buttom

variable allow us to store dating and use them later

we have reusable variables and constant variables

to create variable  u use let keyword, and anything that follows becomes a variable

you dont start a variable with a symbol and a number or end with a symbol

it is aviceable to write a variable with camel cases

when u declare a re usable variable using let, you dont declare it again when you want to use it

when creating a constant variable you use the keyword const

we have single line comment //
multi line commen /*The comment*/

Data Type_______________________

an integer data type is a number without a remainder  eg let int = 1;

a float is an integer number with a remainder eg let float = 233.66;

a string is a multiple data or text that you want to put together eg let string = "This is a string";

you can use either a single quaote or double while writing a string 
 you can use a backward slash \ to escape while using single quaote in a single quoate

a boolean data type is kind of an answer to a question either true of false
it is usually used to set rules

an array is a data type that allows us to hold more than one value or more than one data type
an array can hold any type of data type can be written with []
array index allows you to log one of the items the array is holding
every index items in an array start with zero

objects data type are any particular thing that hold properties and has methods

js operators____________________________

arithmetic opertors
assignment opreator is just like gining a particular value to  varible 
whenever you use the += sign it means add the first variable and carry it to the second variable

increament and decreament you can use it to do a count up or count down ++ --

create and array and log them out, use the integer for mathematics

conditional statement are the rules we are building on our application eg if else if and else

== is compering two value
= is an assignment operator 
=== will check the value and data type if there are same
!= is not equal to sign
> greater than canparison operator 
>=
< lessan than 
<= lesser than or equal to operator

logical operator eg and and or
&& and logical operator is to make sure both condition are true
|| or logical operator is to make sure one of the condition are true
alert__ will only send out message
prompt___ pop out question or value from user
confirm___ fuction helps us to return a boolean and it sent either true or false

concatinate is to add 


build a voting system that check vote 
john doe
if name is john doe and age is lesser than 18 tell him he can go ahead and vote

build an age calaculator
user provide year and we canculate age, and if age falls below 1 - 5 say you are a toddler at age + age
when age is 6 - 12 say you are a kid at age + age
wen age is 13-19 say you are a teenager 
wen age is 20-35 say you are a youth 
wen age is greater than 35 say you are a senior citizen at age + age
